    <span class='style1'>Dr. Santos' Bio:</span>
  </p>
  <p>I was born here in Indianapolis, but my family soon moved to Crawfordsville, Indiana, which I consider to be my hometown.  I graduated from Crawfordsville High School and moved on to Indiana University.  There, I joined Kappa Alpha Theta sorority, and graduated with highest distinction with a major in biology and a minor in Spanish.  Following undergrad, I moved to Indianapolis to attend the Indiana University School of Medicine.  After commencement, I moved to Columbus, Ohio, and completed my pediatrics residency at Columbus Children’s Hospital.  After finishing residency, I came back to Indianapolis and joined Drs. Stump and Collings at Step By Step Pediatrics.</p>
  <p>I met my husband Joe during my third year of medical school when he was one of the interns on my internal medicine rotation.  We began dating shortly thereafter.  He moved to Columbus one year after I did to complete a fellowship in nephrology at Ohio State.  We were married in July of 2005 (the same year we finished our training and moved back to Indianapolis to start our new jobs – what a summer!).  Joe now practices primarily out of St. Francis and Methodist Hospitals.</p>
  <p>In June 2007, Joe and I welcomed our first child – a daughter named Louisa Lynn.  With her arrival, our pastimes changed from traveling, listening to live music, running, and attending sporting events to changing diapers, doing laundry, and marveling at every new expression or discovery she made.  Louisa quickly outgrew our trendy downtown condo, so we moved to the suburbs in 2008.</p>
  <p>We were thrilled in 2011 when our second daughter, Tessa Jane, arrived. We love our life as a family of four and have discovered that there is nothing more heartwarming than hearing our children laugh together. I am amazed by my daughters every day, and I feel very lucky that I am able to share in my patients' new stories and achievements, too.</p>
