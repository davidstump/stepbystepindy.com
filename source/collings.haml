    %span.style1 Dr. Collings' Bio:
  %p My mother came up with the name Chrissa. (Now Chrissa is the American Girl doll of 2009!) I was raised in Danville, the older of 2. I’ve been to every state in the country, thanks to my parents. I participated in about everything in school from Girl Scouts to sports to Student Council to choir. My mother was a pediatric nurse and I babysat often and was a camp counselor for a few summers. It seemed natural for me to go into Pediatrics after attending Miami University and I.U. School of Medicine.                                                            
  %p I married Rick, now a retired High School teacher, 30 plus years ago during med school, then took him to Nashville, TN where I did my Pediatric training at Vanderbilt. We had our first son, Brian in Tennessee, but moved back to Indiana where we had grandparent support and I landed a job working with Dr. Stump! Mike came along soon. Both my boys are fine, young men. Mike is in Youth Ministry & is married to Carey who is a nurse. They recently moved back to Indianapolis after serving with a mission in Haiti. Brian graduated from Rose-Hulman, married Lindsay (a pediatric nurse), and is working as a mechanical engineer in Lafayette. Lindsey works part-time in our office, but is busy full time as mother to my precious granddaughter, Leah. Rick taught and coached at Avon High School for many years, but is now working at home. He is focusing on improving his water skiing skills and my boat driving abilities.
  %p We are empty nesters, but will stay busy with our activities at Chapel Rock Christian Church, travel with missions and just for fun, and our family get-togethers. I recently went on my 14th medical mission trip to Haiti with the H.E.A.L.T.H. team in February ’13. We also host an annual Croquet & Frisbee Golf tournament for dozens of our friends. I won the tournament 7 years ago, which is one of my greatest accomplishments ever. I love people, especially kids – of all ages. I’m proud of my own, and those I’ve watched grow up in my practice. I’m a scrap booker, like Dr. Stump. I’ve cut out pictures of my patients from newspapers for years. Now if I have free time, I’ll start a scrapbook of pictures for my office. I love what I do and just like I tell the kids, I never want to stop learning.
